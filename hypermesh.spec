## Overview

HyperMesh is a distributed computing platform that rebuilds cloud infrastructure from the ground up, eliminating systemic security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural debt that plague current container orchestration systems.

### Primary Mission
Create a secure-by-design, infinitely scalable, resource-efficient distributed computing platform with native P2P capabilities and exceptional developer experience.

## Architecture Overview

HyperMesh implements a 3-layer architecture:
- **STOQ Layer**: Standalone transport and storage protocol
- **Nexus Layer**: Orchestration and service management 
- **HyperMesh Layer**: Complete distributed computing platform

## Core Requirements

### Security by Design
- QUIC over IPv6 with certificate-based authentication
- Memory-safe Rust implementation eliminating vulnerability classes
- eBPF kernel integration for secure system-level operations
- Zero-trust architecture with triple validation
- Hardware-assisted virtualization with capability-based security

### Performance Without Compromise
- Full-duplex QUIC protocol eliminating TCP overhead
- Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time guarantees
- Kernel bypass through eBPF programs
- Predictable latency with no garbage collection
- Real-time monitoring and adaptive resource allocation

### Distributed-First Architecture  
- P2P mesh networks with direct node connectivity
- Byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanisms
- Geographic distribution with data locality
- Network partition resilience with automatic healing
- Multi-cloud abstraction for true portability

## Component Specifications

Detailed specifications are organized in the ./specs/ subdirectory:

### Core Layer (./specs/core/)
- **transport.spec** - QUIC/IPv6 transport protocol implementation
- **consensus.spec** - Distributed state engine with Raft+BFT
- **container.spec** - Secure container runtime with hardware isolation
- **security.spec** - eBPF security framework and threat model

### Platform Layer (./specs/platform/)
- **orchestration.spec** - Service mesh and resource scheduler
- **api.spec** - REST/GraphQL/WebSocket API contracts
- **cli.spec** - Nexus CLI command specification
- **integration.spec** - Multi-cloud and external system integration

### Operations Layer (./specs/operations/)
- **monitoring.spec** - Observability and telemetry requirements
- **deployment.spec** - CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure automation
- **compliance.spec** - Security standards and audit requirements
- **performance.spec** - SLA targets and benchmarking criteria

## Key Performance Targets

### Throughput and Latency

### Scale and Reliability
- Linear scaling to 1,000,000+ nodes
- >99.99% availability with automatic failover
- >90% cache hit ratio with geographic optimization
- Zero-downtime certificate rotation (24-hour cycle)
- Byzantine fault tolerance up to 33% compromised nodes

### Resource Efficiency
