### **Repository Sync Commands**
```bash
./sync-repos.sh              # Sync all components
./sync-repos.sh stoq         # Sync specific component  
./sync-repos.sh --dry-run    # Preview changes
./deploy-all.sh              # One-command deployment
```

## 🔧 **Critical Gaps (Next Priority)**

### **1. STOQ Performance (CRITICAL - 2-3 weeks)**
- Root cause: QUIC implementation bottlenecks
- Target: Minimum 10 Gbps for Phase 1 deployment
- Current: Functional but severely underperforming

### **2. Production Infrastructure (HIGH - 1-2 weeks)**
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Monitoring/alerting (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Database layer (PostgreSQL production storage)
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

### **3. Real Multi-Node Testing (HIGH - 1 week)**
- Deploy across actual cloud infrastructure
- Test 10K+ concurrent connections  
- Validate Byzantine fault scenarios with real malicious nodes
- Network partition recovery testing

## 📋 **Core Architecture (Technical Reference)**

### **NKrypt Four-Proof Consensus System (✅ Implemented)**
**Reference**: `/home/persist/repos/personal/NKrypt/src/` (original patterns)

**CRITICAL**: Every asset requires ALL FOUR proofs (not split by type):
- **PoSpace (PoSp)**: WHERE - storage location and physical/network location
- **PoStake (PoSt)**: WHO - ownership, access rights, and economic stake  
- **PoWork (PoWk)**: WHAT/HOW - computational resources and processing
- **PoTime (PoTm)**: WHEN - temporal ordering and timestamp validation

**Combined**: Unified "Consensus Proof" answering WHERE/WHO/WHAT/WHEN for every block/asset

### **HyperMesh Asset System (✅ Core Implemented)**
**Location**: `/hypermesh/src/assets/core/mod.rs` (actively being developed)

**Universal Requirements**:
- Everything in HyperMesh is an Asset (containers, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, services)
- Universal AssetId system with blockchain registration
- AssetAdapter trait for specialized handling (from NKrypt patterns)
- Remote proxy addressing (NAT-like for memory) - **CRITICAL requirement**

**Asset Adapter Pattern** (All Required):
```rust
// CPU Asset Adapter - with Consensus Proof validation
pub struct CpuAssetAdapter; // PoWk validation, time-based scheduling
// GPU Asset Adapter - quantum-resistant security, NAT-like GPU memory addressing  
pub struct GpuAssetAdapter; // FALCON-1024 for GPU access control
// Memory Asset Adapter - **CRITICAL** NAT-like memory addressing system
pub struct MemoryAssetAdapter; // PoSp proofs, user-configurable memory sharing
// Storage Asset Adapter - sharding and encryption, PoSp for storage commitment
pub struct StorageAssetAdapter; // Kyber encryption, content-aware segmentation
```

### **Privacy-Aware Resource Allocation (Required)**
**Privacy Allocation Types** (from NKrypt):
- **Private**: Internal network only, no external access
- **Public**: Cross-network accessible, full discovery
- **Anonymous**: No identity tracking, privacy-first sharing
- **Verified**: Full consensus validation required (PoSp+PoSt+PoWk+PoTm)

**Privacy Levels**:
- `Private`: No public access
- `PrivateNetwork`: Specific networks/groups
- `P2P`: Trusted peer sharing
- `PublicNetwork`: Specific public networks  
- `FullPublic`: Maximum CAESAR rewards, full HyperMesh node

**User Controls** (All Mandatory):
- Resource allocation percentages (0-100% per resource type)
- Concurrent usage limits, rewards configuration, duration limits
- Consensus requirements (which proofs: PoSp/PoSt/PoWk/PoTm)
- Remote proxy settings (NAT-like addressing preferences)

### **Remote Proxy/NAT System (CRITICAL - Highest Priority)**
**Location**: `/hypermesh/src/assets/proxy/` 

**Core Requirements**:
- **NAT-like addressing for memory/resources** (primary requirement)
- Global proxy addresses (IPv6-like addressing for HyperMesh ecosystem)  
- Trust-based proxy selection using PoSt (Proof of Stake) validation
- Federated trust integration with TrustChain certificate hierarchy
- Sharded data access through encrypted/sharded pools
- User-configurable privacy-aware proxy selection and routing

### **Circular Dependency Bootstrap Solution**
**Problem**:
```
HyperMesh → needs DNS resolution → TrustChain
TrustChain → needs blockchain consensus → HyperMesh
Both → need secure transport → STOQ  
STOQ → needs certificate validation → TrustChain
```

**Solution Status**:
- ✅ TrustChain starts with traditional DNS (trust.hypermesh.online)
- ✅ STOQ extracted as standalone protocol
- ✅ Phased bootstrap approach: Phase 0 (traditional) → Phase 3 (federated)

### **Domain/Namespace Goals**
**Target Resolution**:
- `http3://hypermesh` → HyperMesh global dashboard
- `http3://caesar` → Caesar wallet/exchange
- `http3://trust` → TrustChain management  
- `http3://assets` → HyperMesh asset management

### **VM Integration with Asset System (Required)**
**Catalog provides VM, HyperMesh needs integration**:
- Julia VM execution through secure remote code execution
- Consensus proof validation: Every execution requires PoSp+PoSt+PoWk+PoTm
- VM resource allocation through Asset Adapters
- VM executes through NAT-like memory addressing
- Asset-aware execution: VM treats all resources as HyperMesh Assets

## 🎯 **Next Actions (Context for Resumption)**

### **Immediate Priority (Choose One)**
1. **Performance First**: Fix STOQ 40 Gbps → Full production (3-4 weeks)
2. **Deploy Current**: Launch with 2.95 Gbps + monitoring → Scale later (1-2 weeks)
3. **Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD, monitoring → Enterprise ready (4-6 weeks)

### **Key Files for Development**
- `/hypermesh/src/assets/core/mod.rs` - Asset core system (actively developed)
- `/hypermesh/src/assets/adapters/` - Hardware asset adapters  
- `/hypermesh/src/assets/proxy/` - Remote proxy/NAT system (highest priority)
- `/stoq/src/transport/mod.rs` - QUIC transport implementation
- `/trustchain/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Foundation layer design
- `/BOOTSTRAP_ROADMAP.md` - Phased approach to circular dependencies

### **Architecture Decisions Made**
- ✅ Separate protocols (TrustChain, STOQ, Catalog) from HyperMesh
- ✅ Catalog provides VM/assets, HyperMesh orchestrates
- ✅ Everything becomes HyperMesh Asset with remote addressing  
- ✅ User-configurable privacy levels for resource sharing
- ✅ IPv6-only networking throughout ecosystem

**Decision Point**: Performance optimization vs. staged deployment with current capabilities?
