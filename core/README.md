# Nexus - Core System Components

This directory contains the Nexus core system components, the foundational infrastructure layer implemented primarily in Rust with eBPF programs for kernel-level operations.

## Key Technologies

- **Rust**: Memory-safe systems programming with zero-cost abstractions
- **eBPF**: Kernel-level networking and security policy enforcement
- **QUIC**: Modern transport protocol with built-in security and multiplexing
- **Hardware Virtualization**: Intel VT-x/AMD-V for secure container isolation
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed state management

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update stable

# Install eBPF toolchain
sudo apt-get install -y clang llvm libelf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)

# Install additional dependencies
cargo install cargo-ebpf bindgen-cli
```

### Building Core Components
```bash
# Build all core components
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build eBPF programs
cargo ebpf build --target bpfel-unknown-none
```

## Component Status

- [ ] **Transport Layer**: QUIC protocol implementation with certificate integration
- [ ] **Container Runtime**: Secure isolation with hardware virtualization
- [ ] **State Engine**: Distributed consensus and key-value storage
- [ ] **Scheduler**: Intelligent workload placement and auto-scaling
- [ ] **Service Mesh**: P2P networking with load balancing
- [ ] **Security Framework**: Triple validation and policy enforcement
- [ ] **eBPF Integration**: Kernel-level networking and monitoring
- [ ] **API Server**: REST API with authentication and authorization

## Performance Targets

- Container startup: <100ms
- Network latency: <1ms for local communication
- Consensus latency: <10ms for state updates
- Throughput: >1M requests/second per node
- Memory overhead: <50MB per container

## Security Goals

- Zero remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Hardware-enforced isolation boundaries
- Automatic certificate rotation every 24 hours
- Real-time security policy enforcement
- Comprehensive audit logging
