# Changelog - HyperMesh Core Runtime

All notable changes to the HyperMesh Core Runtime project are documented here.

## [Unreleased] - Refactor Phase 1

### 2025-09-04 - Emergency Stabilization (70% Complete)

#### Added
- Git repository initialization with proper version control
- Comprehensive refactor plan (6-week timeline)
- Modular architecture specification
- Quality gates framework documentation
- Phase 1 emergency stabilization report

#### Changed
- Modularized health.rs from 2,301 lines to proper module structure
- Modularized transport_integration.rs from 2,208 lines to submodules
- Modularized networking.rs from 1,087 lines to organized modules
- Reduced compilation errors from 195 to 88 (55% reduction)

#### Fixed
- Partial resolution of build system failures
- Initial addressing of massive file size violations (3 of 18 files)
- Started cleanup of monolithic code structures

#### Identified Issues
- 15 files still exceed 500-line limit (509-843 lines each)
- 88 compilation errors preventing successful builds
- RocksDB integration causing build failures (needs replacement)
- Documentation claims "production-ready" status despite critical issues
- No test infrastructure or coverage
- Tight coupling between modules violating SOLID principles

### 2025-09-03 - Quality Review Conducted

#### Discovered
- Critical code quality violations throughout codebase
- 18 files exceeding 500-line limit (worst: 2,301 lines)
- 195 compilation errors in runtime crate
- No Git repository for version control
- Test infrastructure broken or non-existent
- Documentation misaligned with actual implementation

#### Decisions
- Immediate 6-week comprehensive refactor required
- Phase 1: Emergency stabilization (1 week)
- Phase 2: Code quality compliance (3 weeks)
- Phase 3: Architecture redesign (1.5 weeks)
- Phase 4: Quality assurance (1.5 weeks)

### Previous Work (Sprint 1-2)

#### Attempted
- Initial runtime implementation
- Container orchestration features
- Consensus integration
- Health monitoring system

#### Issues
- Code quality standards not enforced
- Massive monolithic files created
- No proper testing implemented
- Build system left in broken state
- Features claimed but not properly implemented

## Summary of Current State

### What Works
- Basic module structure exists
- Core logic implemented (though needs refactoring)
- Git repository now initialized

### What's Broken
- Build system (88 compilation errors)
- Test infrastructure (0% coverage)
- 15 files violating size limits
- Documentation accuracy (~60% false claims)

### What's Missing
- Proper modular architecture
- Dependency injection
- Comprehensive testing
- Accurate documentation
- CI/CD pipeline
- Quality gates

## Roadmap to Production

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (70% complete)
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Begin fixing compilation errors (55% done)
- [x] Start modularizing oversized files (3/18 done)
- [ ] Complete all compilation fixes
- [ ] Finish file modularization
- [ ] Replace RocksDB with Sled

### Phase 2: Code Quality Compliance (0% complete)
- [ ] Implement SOLID principles
- [ ] Add dependency injection
- [ ] Create unit tests (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Enforce quality gates

### Phase 3: Architecture Redesign (0% complete)
- [ ] Clean architectural patterns
- [ ] Eliminate technical debt
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Interface contracts

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (0% complete)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation alignment

## Important Notes

**This codebase is NOT production-ready.** Significant refactoring is required before any production deployment should be considered. Current state has critical quality violations that must be resolved through the complete 6-week refactor plan.
