# HyperMesh - Distributed Asset Management System

**Status: ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT - Core Systems Operational**

HyperMesh is a distributed asset management system with STOQ protocol transport, NKrypt consensus proofs, and quantum-resistant security. Built on Rust with QUIC over IPv6.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd hypermesh

# 2. Build the core system
cargo build --release

# 3. Run STOQ protocol tests
cargo test --manifest-path protocols/stoq/Cargo.toml

# 4. Test asset adapters
cargo test --manifest-path src/assets/tests/
```

**Current Status**: Core transport and asset systems operational, UI components in development.

- Quantum-resistant security preparation

**4. Web3 Integration**
