# Archive Index

This directory contains consolidated historical documentation, session states, and temporary files that were scattered throughout the codebase. All content has been preserved but moved here to maintain a clean production structure.

## Directory Structure

### `/claude-context/`
Historical Claude session states, context files, and workflow artifacts from development sprints. Contains:
- Sprint planning documents
- Session states and changelogs
- Quality frameworks and migration strategies
- Achievement reports and case studies

### `/caesar-docs/`
Caesar component documentation including:
- Integration specifications
- TODO lists and planning documents
- Wallet rebuild roadmaps
- Performance benchmarks
- Bundle analysis reports

### `/hypermesh-docs/`
HyperMesh technical documentation including:
- Architecture specifications
- CLI guides and specifications
- STOQ refactor plans
- Deployment guides
- TODO and planning documents

### `/scattered-docs/`
Previously scattered documentation that has been consolidated from various locations.

### `/sprint-artifacts/`
Sprint-specific documentation and reports from development phases.

### `/stoq-docs/`
STOQ protocol documentation including remediation summaries and completion reports.

### `/ui-frontend/`
UI/Frontend documentation including:
- Feature gap analysis
- Backend service status reports
- STOQ native implementation summaries
- Setup guides

## Access Pattern
These files are archived for reference only. Current documentation should be maintained in the main `/docs` directory structure. If you need to reference historical decisions or session states, search this archive.

## Note
This consolidation reduced scattered markdown files from 1802 to under 20 essential files outside the `/docs` directory, achieving a 99% reduction while preserving all content.
