# Satchel Wallet UI Redesign Project Handoff

## Project Overview
Transform Satchel Wallet from current state into professional Caesar token ecosystem interface.

## Current State Assessment
- **Location**: `/home/persist/repos/projects/web3/caesar/scrolls-app/satchel-wallet`
- **Running**: localhost:3002
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Comprehensive Design System

### Components Status:
- ✅ **Updated**: WalletCard, TokenList, MultiChainSelector  
- ❌ **Need Work**: BankAccountManager, TransactionHistory, DeFiDashboard, DEXTrading

## Project Scope
Transform four remaining components to match professional Caesar token ecosystem:

- Enhanced Caesar economic education
- Improved demurrage explanations
- Better visual hierarchy for purchase flows

### 2. TransactionHistory (/src/components/TransactionHistory.tsx)
**Current Issues:**  
- Good functionality, needs visual polish
- Caesar-specific insights underdeveloped
- Economic activity metrics need enhancement

**Requirements:**
