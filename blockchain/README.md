# HyperMesh - Blockchain Integration

This directory contains the HyperMesh blockchain and distributed ledger integration components, enabling decentralized governance, resource accounting, and trust networks across the platform.

## Strategic Vision

Once Nexus core infrastructure is mature and the interface layer provides a solid developer experience, HyperMesh blockchain integration offers transformative opportunities:

- **Decentralized Resource Markets**: Peer-to-peer computing resource trading
- **Trustless Multi-party Computation**: Secure computation across untrusted nodes
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Blockchain-based compliance and governance
- **Incentive Mechanisms**: Token-based rewards for resource providers
- **Cross-cluster Federation**: Trust establishment between independent clusters

## Core Blockchain Components

### Consensus Layer
**Proof-of-Stake with Resource Validation**
- **Validator Selection**: Stake-weighted selection with resource contribution metrics
- **Block Production**: Fast block times (<3 seconds) with immediate finality
- **Slashing Conditions**: Penalties for validator misbehavior and resource fraud
- **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate stake to validator nodes
- **Cross-shard Communication**: Support for horizontal scaling across multiple shards

### Smart Contract Runtime
**WebAssembly-based Execution Environment**
- **WASM Runtime**: Secure, sandboxed execution for smart contracts
- **Gas Metering**: Resource consumption tracking and billing
- **State Management**: Efficient state storage with Merkle tree verification
- **Upgradability**: Proxy contracts with governance-controlled upgrades
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain communication protocols

### Token Economics
**Multi-token Resource Economy**
- **Utility Token (HYPER)**: Primary token for transaction fees and governance
- **Resource Tokens**: CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth tokens
- **Reward Distribution**: Validator rewards and resource provider incentives  
- **Burning Mechanisms**: Deflationary token economics through fee burning
- **Vesting Schedules**: Long-term alignment for core contributors

## Integration with HyperMesh Core

### Resource Accounting
```rust
// Example: Blockchain-tracked resource usage
pub struct ResourceTransaction {
    pub node_id: NodeId,
    pub resource_type: ResourceType, // CPU, Memory, Storage, Network
    pub amount: u64,
    pub duration: u64,
    pub price_per_unit: u64,
    pub consumer: AccountId,
    pub provider: AccountId,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```
